# Python-Data-Visualization-Project-High-and-low-Temps
This is a Python project that I completed using the book from No Starch Press entitled Python Crash Course 2nd Edition by Eric Matthes, it uses both CSV and JSON file types to analyze large quantitative data sets featuring the high and low temperatures gathered from Sitka AK and Death Valley CA.
