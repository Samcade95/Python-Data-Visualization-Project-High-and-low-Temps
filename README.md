# Python-Data-Visualization-Project-High-and-Low-Temps
This is a Python project that I completed using the book from No Starch Press entitled Python Crash Course 2nd Edition by Eric Matthes, it uses both CSV and JSON file types to analyze large quantitative data sets featuring the high and low temperatures gathered from Sitka AK and Death Valley CA. 

Hello, with this Python project I examined several large Quantitative Datasets using both CSV and JSON file types. 
These Datasets featured the high and low temperatures of Sitka, Alaska and Death Valley California. 
Using Python and JSON code I was able to gain insights such as earthquake magnitude in both areas, record temperature readings, and a 1-30 day comparison of seismic activity from the USGS in both states.
