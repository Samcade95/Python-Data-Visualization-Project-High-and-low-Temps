Hello, with this Python project I examined several large Quantitative Datasets using both CSV and JSON file types. 
These Datasets featured the high and low temperatures of Sitka, Alaska and Death Valley California. 
Using Python and JSON code I was able to gain insights such as earthquake magnitude in both areas, record temperature readings, and a 1-30 day comparison of seismic activity from the USGS in both states.
